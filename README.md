# Recoding in Letter Series - An ACT-R Model

As a final project for the course Cognitive Modeling, I implemented an ACT-R model to simulate the experiment "Pauses as Recoding Points in Letter Series" by Bower & Springston (1970). The model encodes letters as it "hears" them, and during pauses, recodes the most recent chunk as a more meaningful unit (if this chunk has some sort of semantic meaning). The simulation of the experiment was written in Lisp.
